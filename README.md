# Chat Room

I found an interesting article on betterprogramming that shared how to go through and build a chat room via Golang. 

[Here is that article](https://betterprogramming.pub/how-to-build-a-concurrent-chat-app-with-golang-and-websockets-fb48562a1329)

This project is me working through that guide, learning a bit more about Go beyond just building an API.


Tech: 
1. Go
2. Redis
3. HTML/JS
